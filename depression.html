        <!-- basic description of depression -->
        Depression is a multifaceted mental health disorder characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness,
        hopelessness,
        and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities. It can disrupt daily functioning, affecting
        work,
        relationships, and overall quality of life. <br><br> Symptoms may include:<br>
    </p>
    <ol class="depressiontext">
        <!-- symptoms -->
        <li> Emotional Symptoms - Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness; irritability; feelings of
            worthlessness or excessive guilt; difficulty concentrating or making decisions.<br></li>
        <li> Physical Symptoms - Changes in appetite or weight; sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia); fatigue or
            loss of energy; psychomotor agitation or retardation (restlessness or slowed movements).<br></li>

    </ol>
    <h1 class="Depressionh1">Misconceptions of Depression</h1><br>

    <!-- misconceptions:  -->
    <p class="depressiontext">One of the most common misconceptions is that depression is prolonged sadness. Depression
        can manifest in various ways, including numbness, irritability, fatigue, and apathy. It's not always about
        feeling sad; sometimes,
        it’s a lack of feeling altogether. Many people believe that depression is a sign of weakness, and because of
        this, many individuals don’t seek help in fear of seeming weak.<br><br>

        Another misconception is that people can ignore depression, or tell a person with depression they can control if
        they are happy or not.
        This ignores the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that contribute to
        the condition. Recovery often requires professional support, therapy, and sometimes medication.
        Just forcing someone to be happy doesn’t make them less depressed, it can make them more depressed because they
        feel like there’s an expectation to be happy and it’s not followed.<br>

        What is also quite commonly assumed is that only specific groups of people, like those who have faced trauma can
        experience depression.
        In reality, it can affect anyone, regardless of background, age, or life circumstances.<br><br>

    <h1 class="Depressionh1">Romanticization of Depression</h1><br>
    <!-- romanticization -->
    <p class="depressiontext">Depression is often romanticized in pop culture, especially on social media. Influencers,
        in many cases, say they have depression to gain sympathy and recognition, while influencers who do have
        depression struggle.
        Even though to the public they are both depressed, Influencer 2 is actually going through the struggles of
        depression and Influencer 1 isn’t, and will be up more to post then 2, making Influencer 1’s chances of
        recognition higher.
        Here’s what are side effects of romanticizing depression like Influencer 1.<br>
    </p>

    <ol class="depressiontext">
        <li> Minimization of Suffering: By romanticizing depression, the possibility of believing that depression is not
            as bad as it seems becomes higher. The real pain and suffering that individuals experience. This can lead to
            a misunderstanding of the disorder as something that is glamorous rather than a serious health issue. </li>
        

        <li> Stereotypes: The romanticized view often reinforces stereotypes about mental illness, leading to
            misconceptions that people with depression are always withdrawn and lonely. This can create a false
            narrative that may prevent others from recognizing or empathizing with those who experience the disorder but
            don’t fit the stereotype.</li>

        <li> Clinging On: For some, the romanticization of depression can lead to an unhealthy identification with the
            disorder. Instead of seeking healing, individuals might cling to their depression as a part of their
            identity, slowing down their recovery journey. Because they do not believe it is as bad, they try to ignore
            the depression while it is growing.</li>
