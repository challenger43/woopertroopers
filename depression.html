        Depression is a multifaceted mental health disorder characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness, hopelessness, 
        and a lack of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities. It can disrupt daily functioning, affecting work, 
        relationships, and overall quality of life. <br><br> Symptoms may include:<br><br>
        
        Emotional Symptoms - Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness; irritability; feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt; difficulty concentrating or making decisions.<br><br>
        Physical Symptoms - Changes in appetite or weight; sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia); fatigue or loss of energy; psychomotor agitation or retardation (restlessness or slowed movements).<br><br>
        Cognitive Symptoms - Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or remembering details; recurring thoughts of death or suicide.<br><br>
        Misconceptions of Depression<br>

    One of the most common misconceptions is that depression is prolonged sadness. Depression can manifest in various ways, including numbness, irritability, fatigue, and apathy. It's not always about feeling sad; sometimes,
  it’s a lack of feeling altogether. Many people believe that depression is a sign of weakness, and because of this, many individuals don’t seek help in fear of seeming weak.
 
    Another misconception is that people can ignore depression, or tell a person with depression they can control if they are happy or not. 
 This ignores the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that contribute to the condition. Recovery often requires professional support, therapy, and sometimes medication. 
 Just forcing someone to be happy doesn’t make them less depressed, it can make them more depressed because they feel like there’s an expectation to be happy and it’s not followed.
What is quite commonly assumed is that only specific groups of people, like those who have faced trauma can experience depression. 
In reality, it can affect anyone, regardless of background, age, or life circumstances.
