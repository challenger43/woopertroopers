<p>Misconceptions of OCD

  1. It's Just About Being Neat: Many people think Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is just about being organized. 
  While many people who have OCD may have cleanliness compulsions, the disorder encompasses a wide range of obsessions and compulsions that can be more than just neatness.
  
  2. Everyone Has a Little OCD: The term "OCD" is often casually used to describe minor preferences for order or routine. 
  This disparages the disorder and ignores the significant distress and impairment that people with OCD experience. Itâ€™s a clinical condition, not a personality quirk.
  
  3. People with OCD are Just Overly Anxious: While anxiety is a component of OCD, OCD is not an anxiety disorder.
   OCD involves specific obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (ritualistic behaviors) that can be very distressing and time-consuming, often impacting daily functioning.
  
  4. You Can Just Will It Away: There is a misconception that individuals can control their obsessive thoughts or stop their compulsive behaviors through willpower. 
  However, OCD is a complex disorder that typically requires treatment, such as therapy and/or medication.
