        <p> Post Tramatic Stress Disorder(PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by witnessing a tramatic event.
            It
            can affect anyone that has gone through a tramatic experiance, not just soldiers who have fought in wars.

        <h2> Details of PTSD</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Intrusive Memories: Flashbacks, nightmares, and unwanted thoughts about the tramatic event. This can cause
                intense physical and mental reaction, such as sweating, shaking and panic attacks</li>
            
            <li>Avoidance: A person may avoid people, places, and activies that remind them of the trauma. They might
                withdraw from social situations or lose interest in things they once before enjoyed.</li>
        
            <li>Negative Moods and Thoughts: Feelings of guilt, shame, or detachment. 
                    People may have negative thoughts about themselves, other, and the world around them, and feel emotionally numb or disconnected.</li>
            <li>Hyperarousal: Increased irritability, difficulty sleeping, being easily startled, or feeling tense or "on edge" all the time.
                     This can contribute to heightened anxiety and physical symptoms such as heart palpitations.
                     These symptoms can persist for months or even years after the traumatic event and can significantly impact a personâ€™s ability to function in everyday life.
                     The severity of PTSD varies, with some individuals experiencing it more intensely than others. </li>
