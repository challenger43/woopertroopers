    <h1> <div class="maintitle" > What is the Romanticization of Mental Health? </div></h1>  
    <p> <div class="intro" > The romanticization of mental health is when someone glorifies the easier parts of mental health to their gain. When widespread, it can make 
        it seem like the struggles of people who are dealing with mental health are easier than it truly is. Along with this, people see the easier parts 
        and want to reap the benefits, such as attention and recognition. 
        Misinformation also adds to the tangle, when people say they have depression, for example, 
        and they say what they feel is depression, and other people believe they have depression because 
        they relates on how the fake depressed person is feeling. This can lead to a large number of misdiagnoses, without
         consulting someone who specilizes in that field and would diagnose you. WOMP WOMP
