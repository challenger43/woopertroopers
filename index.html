    <h1 class="maintitle"> What is the Romanticization of Mental Health?</h1>
    <!-- Text -->
    <p class="intro">The romanticization of mental health is when someone glorifies the easier parts of mental health to
        their gain.
        When widespread, it can make it seem like the struggles of people who are dealing with mental health are easier
        than it truly is.
        Along with this, people see the easier parts and want to reap the benefits, such as pity and recognition.
        Misinformation also adds to the tangle, with people saying they have xyz mental illness because they matched
        some of the symptoms from a video on TikTok.
        This can lead to a large number of misdiagnoses, without consulting someone who would actually diagnose
        depression. <br> <br>


        Additionally, people now tend to use mental illnesses as adjectives. Words like “sad,” “mood swings,” and “being
        organized,” have turned into ‘depressed,’ ‘bipolar,’ and ‘OCD.’
        People no longer say “Aww, I’m sad because I couldn’t go to the movies,” but “I’m depressed because I couldn’t
        go to the movies.”
        Instead of raising mental health awareness, this downplays the struggle of people who actually experience it.
        It is causing people who actually need help to be ignored, or marked off as unimportant. <br> <br>

        In recent years. Tumblr, a blogging social media site has developed the trend of mental illness being
        "mysterious, haunting and fascinating."
        According to a UCLA study on pages 71-81(you can <a
            href="https://urjp.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/76/2018/06/URJP_2018.pdf">read it here</a>), a
        search
        on Tumblr containing key words "self-harm," "depression," and "suicide," brings up pro-suicide quotes such as
        "Suicidal people are angels returning home," and
        pictures of self-harming teens. Even some of the background-pictures on the page include 'beautiful' people with
        perfectly wavy falling hair with light perfectly filtering through it
        - another contribution to the broken but beautiful aesthetic.

        Yet despite the amount of presentations on mental illness and suicide, people still insist on using these terms in everyday conversation.
        Whether its suicide "I'm so stressed about this test, like I'm ACTUALLY going to kill myself," or depression "I'm so depressed I missed that concert,"
        The effects go so much further than just invalidation. Joking about it can make it harder for people who are actually struggling to reach out-for example, 
        someone struggling with suicidal ideations may say, "I just want to die, my life is worthless," but instead of recieving support, their friends might say
        "me too, like if I fail this math test I'm actually gonna kill myself." <br><br>

        So we've said it once and we'll say it again, mental illness is not some trend, not an aesthetic or something that you would wish on anyone. 
        It's important to normalize it- not glorify it.
