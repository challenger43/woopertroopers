    <h1> What is the Romanticization of Mental Health?</h1>
    <p>The romanticization of mental health is when someone glorifies the easier parts of mental health to their gain.
        When widespread, it can make
         it seem like the struggles of people who are dealing with mental health are easier than it truly is. Along with
        this, people see the easier parts
        and want to reap the benefits, such as attention and recognition.
        Misinformation also adds to the tangle, when people say they have depression, for example,
        and they say what they feel is depression, and other people believe they have depression because
        they relats on how the fake depressed person is feeling. This can lead to a large number of misdiagnoses,
        without consulting someone who would
        actually diagnose depression saying they have xyz mental illness because a video on tiktok said so. </p>
