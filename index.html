    <h1 class="maintitle"> What is the Romanticization of Mental Health?</h1>
    <!-- Text -->
    <p class="intro">The romanticization of mental health is when someone glorifies the easier parts of mental health to their gain.
         When widespread, it can make it seem like the struggles of people who are dealing with mental health are easier than it truly is. 
         Along with this, people see the easier parts and want to reap the benefits, such as pity and recognition.
          Misinformation also adds to the tangle, with people saying they have xyz mental illness because they matched some of the symptoms from a video on TikTok.
           This can lead to a large number of misdiagnoses, without consulting someone who would actually diagnose depression. <br> <br>
         

        Additionally, people now tend to use mental illnesses as adjectives. Words like “sad,” “mood swings,” and “being organized,” have turned into ‘depressed,’ ‘bipolar,’ and ‘OCD.’ 
        People no longer say “Aww, I’m sad because I couldn’t go to the movies,” but “I’m depressed because I couldn’t go to the movies.”
         Instead of raising mental health awareness, this downplays the struggle of people who actually experience it. It is causing people who actually need help to be ignored, or marked off as unimportant.
